# Example Docker Application
This is a simple Docker application which is going to be built upon and branched across several Blog entries and will be referred to extensively.

Further, this helps will a hole that there appears to be in provision of a cohesive, followable example of how not only to create a Spring Boot application in a Docker Container, but to provide an automated delivery pipeline from Commit to Deployment.  So, let's make something big and fun!

### Blog Post 1
This post will mainly discuss basic setup of a Docker application with a separate database container, along with the associated Continuous Integration/Deployment pipeline.  This is just a basic pipeline to deploy to a development environment, but it's a quick and easy setup to illustrate how one would go about such a task!

NOTE: If you're spying at my commits and wondering "who else" is contributing, that's also me.  I apparently have multiple GitHub accounts!!  I should unify at some point!!
